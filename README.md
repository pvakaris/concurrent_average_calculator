# Average calculator
***

It was developed to learn more about Java concurrency.

***
This is an implementation of an algorithm that calculates the average of a given array.

It uses multithreading to divide the array amongst multiple threads that calculate sub-averages.

Users can specify the size of the array in the Main file.

This program runs the algorithm with all the given thread amounts ten times and calculates the average time for the algorithm to reach the result.

All the results are then printed to the terminal.
